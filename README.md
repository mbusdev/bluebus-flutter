Google Maps SDK
To use the Google Maps SDK, you will need to create a new project on the Google Cloud Platform and enable the Maps SDK for Android and iOS.

To set your keys for Android, (create and) edit the local.properties file in the android directory and define a API_KEY property with your API key.

To set your keys for iOS, create the gmap.xcconfig file in ios/Flutter and define a GMAP_API_KEY property with your API key for the Google Maps SDK.
